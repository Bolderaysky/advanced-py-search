# Advanced Py Search
## Overview
This is an simple and alternative search methode in integer array written in Python.
## Why I've written that?
I've written that for educational purposes (getting more experience in algorithm developing).
## Why I've posted this on GitHub?
Why not?
## Compatibility
- [x] Arch Linux
- [x] Manjaro Linux
- [ ] Windows
- Honestly, I didn't test it on Windows, but it should work fine.
## How to install all dependencies and use it?
### Using example
Firstly, I want to point that this algorithm has to be imported as module and not used like main app. I provide example of use, so to test it, do this
```
git clone https://github.com/Bolderaysky/advanced-py-search.git
cd advanced-py-search
python example.py
```
### Using in another app
```
git clone https://github.com/Bolderaysky/advanced-py-search.git
cd advanced-py-search
```
Open your ```.py``` file and add
```
import search
```
You are ready to go! Now you can use this module.
